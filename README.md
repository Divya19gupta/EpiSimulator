# Epidemic Spread Simulator: PAIR-C Framework

## Objectives and Intended Outcomes

### Teach students about:​

- The concept of epidemic spread and exponential growth
- The impact and importance of public health measures 

### An interactive simulation:​

- Simulates viral spread and allows for adjusting relevant parameters
- Provides all the relevant information to execute the simulation in line with our objectives

### Enable students to analyze impact of adjustable variables: ​

- Preventive measures such as quarantine and social distancing affect the spread of disease

## Epidemic Spread Simulator: PAIR-C Framework 

### Pattern

- Disease Spread Plot visualizes epidemic progression.
- Simulation starts out with susceptible and carriers, ends with vaccinated/recovered or dead. 

### Agents

- Turtles: Individual agents with tracked health and movement.
- Initial Carriers and Susceptible turtles.

### Interactions

- When a susceptible turtle comes into contact with a carrier, it gets infected. Infected turtles continue to infect other susceptible turtles, later resulting in death or recovery of said turtle.
- Adjustable Factors which affect Interactions:  
  - Transmission Rate
  - Social Distancing & Quarantine
  - Lockdown 

### Relations

- Health & Movement: Links between health status and mobility.
- Vaccination & Susceptibility: Percentage vaccinated affects susceptibility.

### Causality

- Cause and Effect:
  - Transmission and Mortality:
    - Cause: Carriers moving around in space.
    - Effect: Susceptible turtles get infected.
  - Public Health Interventions:
    - Cause: Actions like vaccination, lockdown, social distancing, and quarantine.
    - Effect: Changes in the number of sick, recovered, and dead turtles.
